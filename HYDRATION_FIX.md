## Hydration Error Fix Summary

The hydration error you encountered is now fixed! Here's what was causing it and how I resolved it:

## 🐛 **Root Cause**
The error was caused by:
1. **Browser Extensions** adding attributes like `cz-shortcut-listen="true"` to the body element
2. **Dynamic content** that differs between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering
3. **Timing differences** in component initialization

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Layout.tsx - suppressHydrationWarning**
```tsx
<body
  className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
  suppressHydrationWarning={true}
>
```
This tells React to ignore hydration mismatches on the body element, which is commonly affected by browser extensions.

### 2. **Client-Side Detection Pattern**
Added `isClient` state to components with dynamic behavior:
```tsx
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);
```

### 3. **Dynamic Imports**
Used Next.js dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for components that might cause hydration issues:
```tsx
const Navigation = dynamic(() => import('./components/Navigation'), { ssr: false });
const LoadingScreen = dynamic(() => import('./components/LoadingScreen'), { ssr: false });
```

### 4. **Default Content During SSR**
Provided fallback content for dynamic elements:
```tsx
<span className="font-light">{text || 'Full Stack Developer'}</span>
```

## 🎯 **Components Fixed**
- ✅ **Hero Component** - Fixed typing animation hydration
- ✅ **Navigation Component** - Fixed scroll-based state changes  
- ✅ **LoadingScreen Component** - Prevented SSR/client mismatch
- ✅ **FloatingActionButton** - Fixed scroll-based visibility
- ✅ **Layout** - Added suppressHydrationWarning for browser extensions

## 🚀 **Result**
Your portfolio now loads without hydration errors while maintaining all the beautiful animations and functionality. The website is fully functional at **http://localhost:3001**

The fixes ensure compatibility with browser extensions and provide a smooth user experience across all devices and browsers.
